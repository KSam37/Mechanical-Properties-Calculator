# Mechanical-Properties-Calculator
Graphs and calculates mechanical properties of a material given force and strain data.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Create two excell sheets with stress and strain values in the first column. 
Each file must have the same number of values.
Load both files named "Strain Data" and "Force Data" into the same directory as the main program.
Open the main program in MATLAB.
Define subset spacing. If you aren't sure put 0.
Define area_mm which is the cross sectional area of your tensile bar.
Run program.
